## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Project Overview  
The Hotel Management System (HMS) is a Java-based application designed to streamline hotel operations, including:  
- **Two user roles**:  
  - Administrators (manage rooms/users/bookings)  
  - Guests (book rooms, view reservations)  
- **In-memory data storage**: Uses Java `ArrayLists` (no database)  
- **Design phase**: Preliminary UML diagrams (class/sequence) for Sprint 1.
  
### 1.2 Motivations  
- Address inefficiencies in manual hotel management  
- Provide a scalable solution for small to mid-sized hotels  
- Academic exercise in object-oriented design

## 3. Specification  

### 3.1 Key Concepts & Constraints  

#### Actors:  
- **Admin**: Manages rooms, bookings, and user accounts  
- **Guest**: Books rooms, cancels reservations, updates profile  

#### Communication Model (Client-Server):  
1. **Client**: User interacts via GUI (booking/login requests)  
2. **Server**: Processes requests via Business Logic Layer  
3. **Response**: Displays results in UI  

#### Constraints:  
- ‚ùå No persistent storage (data lost on app closure)  
- ‚ùå Simplified payment simulation (no real gateway)  
- ‚ùå No advanced reporting features  

#### Excluded Features:  
- üö´ Mobile application  
- üö´ Multi-language support  
- üö´ Cloud integration

### 3.2 Functionalities  

#### User Perspective:  
| Functionality    | Description                          | Precondition                     |  
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| Register         | Create account (email/name/password) | -                                |  
| Book Room        | Select room & dates                  | User logged in, room available   |  
| Cancel Booking   | Cancel via booking ID                | User logged in, valid booking ID |  
| Browse Rooms     | View available rooms                 | User logged in                   |  

#### Non-Functional Features:  
1. **Usability**: Intuitive interface for bookings  
2. **Performance**: Fast response to queries  
3. **Scalability**: Handles growing guest/reservation data

## Use Case 1: Book a Room

**Goal:** Allow a customer or receptionist to reserve an available room.

**Actors:** Customer, Receptionist

**Preconditions:**
- User must be authenticated (Receptionist or Customer).
- The room must be available for the selected dates.

**Postconditions:**
- A booking is created and stored in the system.
- Room availability is updated accordingly.

**Normal Flow:**
1. User selects room type and dates.
2. System displays available rooms.
3. User selects a room and enters booking details.
4. System validates data and confirms reservation.
5. Confirmation and booking reference are shown.

**Alternative Flows:**
- If no room is available, the system shows a message and suggests alternatives.
- If payment fails, the reservation is not confirmed.

---

## Use Case 2: Manage Customers

**Goal:** Enable hotel staff to create, edit, or delete customer profiles.

**Actors:** Receptionist, Manager

**Preconditions:**
- User must be authenticated with staff privileges.

**Postconditions:**
- Customer data is stored or updated in the database.

**Normal Flow:**
1. Staff accesses the customer management module.
2. User chooses to create, edit, or delete a customer.
3. System performs the action and confirms success.

**Alternative Flows:**
- If validation fails (e.g., missing name), the system prompts for corrections.
